                    <p>Vegetarian diets tend to be naturally lower in saturated fat and cholesterol
                    and have a higher intake of plant nutrients than most meat-based diets.
                    Vegetarians have been shown to have a 24% lower risk of dying of heart disease
                    than non-vegetarians.</p>

                                        <p> There is evidence that vegetarians tend to have a lower overall 
                                        rate of cancer compared to the general population. 
                                        “Red meat and processed meat consumption is consistently associated 
                                        with an increase in the risk of colo-rectal cancer.”</p>

                                    <p>On average, vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index 
                                        (a measure of body fat) than meat eaters.The Oxford Vegetarian Study 
                                        found that BMI levels are lower in vegetarians of all age groups and 
                                        for both men and women.</p>

                                        that vegetarians outlive meat eaters by six years. Additionally, a vegetarian diet can prevent and

                                            than all the cars and trucks in the world combined. Therefore, the single most important step

                                    <p class="question" >Is a plant-based diet healthier than an omnivorous one?</p>
                                    <p>Plant-based diets are low in saturated fat, free of cholesterol, and rich in fiber,
                                     vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Research reveals that following this type of 
                                     diet will lower your risks of diseases like Heart disease, Hypertension (high blood pressure), 
                                     Diabetes and Colon and breast cancers</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p class="question">Are there any disadvantages for opting to become a vegetarian full time?</p>
                                    <p>Opting for vegetarian diet might means saying goodbye to meat, fish and eggs. 
                                    So you should plan to add supplements for any protein or vitamin deficiency that you might 
                                    encounter due to a sudden change of diets. You can also find multiple sources of protein
                                    in plants.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p class="question">How to make sure you get enough protein being a vegetarian?</p>
                                    <p>You’ll want to make sure that your diet includes enough protein to maintain muscle mass, 
                                    strong bones and healthy skin. The following foods are packed with protein:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Beans, lentils and split peas</li>
                                        <li>Quinoa</li>
                                        <li>Soy products like tofu, tempeh, soy milk</li>
                                        <li>Nuts and Seeds</li>

                                    <p class="question">Does being a vegetarian really help the environment?</p>
                                    <p>Per a study in the scientific-american,Switching to a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet 
                                    would result in a 33 percent decrease in emissions. Vegan diets are 53 percent more
                                     efficient. But there are certain vegetables which might consume more water but produce
                                    less energy when eaten than say meat. But nonetheless vegetarian diets are overall 
                                    a healthy alternative for meats.</p>

                                    <li>The first Vegetarian Society was formed in England in 1847. 
                                    The society’s goal was to teach people that it is possible to be healthy without 
                                    eating meat.</li>
                                    <li>Vegetarianism has roots in ancient India. In fact, currently 70% of the world’s 
                                        vegetarians are Indians and there are more vegetarians in India than in any 
                                        other country in the world.</li>
                                    <li> Only around 20% of the corn grown in the United States is eaten by people, 
                                        with about 80% of the corn eaten by livestock.</li>
                                    <li>Opting for vegetarian food does not mean no more meat.
                                        Creating a good plant-based diet a few times a week would be a healthy start.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        One of the first famous vegetarians was the Greek philosopher Pythagoras 
                                            who lived at the end of the 6th century B.C. In fact, the term “Pythagorean diet” 
                                            was commonly used for a plant-based diet until the term “vegetarian” was coined in the 19th century.
