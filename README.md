# GREEN EATS
<br />

An application to search for vegetarian menus and veg-friendly restaurant by city. It searches recipes and restaurant from Edamam and Zomato to bring the results to the users.

## MOTIVATION
<br />

Being a vegetarian myself for several decades and understanding the benefits of that diet,
I was motivated to inspire others about these advantages as well. This application shares 
a way to hunt for specifically vegetarian recipes and restaurants. It also provides interesting
and fun information about vegetarianism.
